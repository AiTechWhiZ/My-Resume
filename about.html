<p>
  I'm Vijay Sajin, a 19-year-old student diving into the fascinating realms of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. Coding is not just a subject for me; it's a passion that fuels my curiosity and creativity. When I'm not buried in lines of code, you'll find me out on the football field, where I thrive on the energy of the game and the camaraderie of teamwork. And let's not forget my love for food â€“ exploring different cuisines is a hobby that never fails to excite my taste buds and broaden my horizons. With a hunger for knowledge and a love for life's adventures, I'm on a journey to make the most of every opportunity that comes my way
